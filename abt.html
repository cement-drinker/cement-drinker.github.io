			<p> I made this website in a day, though this website's <a href="https://github.com/cement-drinker/cement-drinker.github.io" target="_blank">Github</a> has many earlier versions. This website has light and dark modes, was inspired by the design of <a href="https://manjarno.snorlax.sh" target="_blank">The Manjarno website</a>, and also has a very messy css file. Create a PR or Issue if you want any improvements!</p>
